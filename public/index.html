      content=" We make it as easy as a couple of clicks to go from wanting to play to actually playing. Hook offers a quick-start feature for Web3 games, which typically have a more complicated on-boarding process than traditional video games. Users can easily have an overview of the Web3 game market and swap tokens to take actions in games to enjoy and earn more. See what other Hook users think about a game before you play. With reactions and comments, users can browse for comments that others have found helpful, or write their own comments. "
